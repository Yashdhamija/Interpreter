# Parser-3301-

The class will be divided in groups to design and implement programs for automatic drawing of EBNF syntax diagrams in C. The drawings should be prepared in a widely accepted vector format e.g. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) or PS (PostScript). Note that raster images such as BMP, JPEG, TIFF, etc. are ok for testing but cannot be converted to a vector format.

The design and implementation should follow the approach outlined on p.171: "2. Design a state transition diagram that describes the token patterns of the language and write a program that implements the diagram", implement a Recursive-Descent Parser (RDP) for the language, extend the RDP with interpreter drawing functionality.
